# The Bhasvic chronicles
* This project has been completed as part of a full- stack development course at Codecademy *

## Introduction
The aim of this project is to return a truly random message to the user, in this scenario that message is the outcome of achieving a paticular grade in an exam. The grade and outcomes are randomised, but higher grades achieve better outcomes.

## Technolgies
- JavaScript
- Git
- Github
- Command Line

## Setup and start
This program is written in JavaScript so it is reccomended to run the program on a runtime such as node.js.
Each run of the program will generate a new message with the default library of answers- however there is built in functionaility to add more messages.

### Adding more to the data library
You will need to run main.js inside of a REPL terminal for the most ease, if not this can be done in any code editor. 
- The middle part of the message is bought from the
